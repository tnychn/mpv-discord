## Why?

Currently, there are two alternatives I found on GitHub.

1. [cniw/mpv-discordRPC](https://github.com/cniw/mpv-discordRPC)
2. [noaione/mpv-discordRPC](https://github.com/noaione/mpv-discordRPC)

**Discord RPC**

In order to interact with Discord Rich Presence using RPC, the client needs to connect to Discord's IPC socket.
However, both of the above alternatives do not keep a connection with Discord's IPC socket, which I think is rather unreliable.

See also: [how _mpv-discord_ works](#how-it-works).

**Third-party Dependencies**

Both of the above alternatives require users to install third-party dependencies such as `python-pypresence` or `lua-discordRPC`.
I found it hard to set up the dependencies and I also don't want to mess up my environment.

## Installation

Installer scripts for Windows, Linux and OSX are provided.

1. Download .zip from [the latest release](https://github.com/tnychn/mpv-discord/releases/latest) and extract it.
    * or you can download .zip by clicking on the green download button in GitHub
    * or you can also use `git clone https://github.com/tnychn/mpv-discord.git`
2. Run the installer script of your platform.
    * run `install_darwin.sh` in Terminal for OSX
    * run `install_linux.sh` in Terminal for Linux
    * run `install_windows.bat` by double clicking on it for Windows
3. Before using, you must specify `binary_path` in the config file first.

## Configurations

For OSX and Linux, config file is located in `~/.config/mpv/script-opts`.

For Windows, config file is located in where the `mpv.exe` executable is.

* **key** (default: `D`): key binding to toggle activation on the fly
* **active** (default: `yes`): whether to activate at launch
* **client_id**: specify your own client ID to [customize](#customization) the images shown in Rich Presence
* **binary_path**: full path to mpv-discord's binary file
* **socket_path** (default: `/tmp/mpvsocket` or `mpvsocket` in Windows):
  * You can use `{pid}` to use a dynamic name for the socket path (i.e., `/tmp/mpvsocket_{pid}`)
* **autohide_threshold** (default: `0`): time in seconds before hiding the presence once player is paused (`0` is off)

## Customization

Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications),
create an application and upload the following art assets with their corresponding asset keys:
* `mpv`: large image (app logo)
* `play`: small image used when playing
* `pause`: small image used when paused
* `loop`: small image used when playing and looping
* `buffer`: small image used when buffering

Then, set the `client_id` option in the config to the application ID.

You can also find the already provided client ids and their image assets [here](./assets/).

## How It Works

This plugin consists of 3 files.

1. [`discord.lua`](./scripts/discord.lua) -- mpv user script
2. [`discord.conf`](./script-opts/discord.conf) -- configuration file
3. [`mpv-discord` binary](./mpv-discord/main.go) -- backend binary of the plugin

When mpv launches, mpv will run all the user scripts including `discord.lua`.
Then `discord.lua` will read the configurations from `discord.conf` and do two things:
(1) create an `input-ipc-server` socket of mpv. (2) start a subprocess of the `mpv-discord` binary.
Then, `mpv-discord` will interact with the `input-ipc-server` to get the player state and properties of mpv.
Finally, `mpv-discord` will update Discord's Rich Presence with the properties through Discord's IPC socket.
